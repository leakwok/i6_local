                    <p>"Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that even if you run, you cannot hide." - from the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/agents/sova/" target="_new">official Valorant Sova page</a></p>

                    <p>Valorant is "a 5v5 tac-shooter matchup to plant or defuse the Spike in a one-life-per-round, first to 13 series. More than guns and bullets, youâ€™ll choose an Agent armed with adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to let your gunplay shine." - from the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_new">official Riot Games page</a></p>

                <h3>Why Do I Play?</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy playing games with my friends and also having a skill to improve on while in quarantine. A few years ago, I played Fortnite, which has similar concepts, but doesn't have a huge emphasis on the team aspect, which I really enjoy about Valorant.</p>
